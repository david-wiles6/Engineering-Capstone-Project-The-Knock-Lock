\maketitle

This week, we finished about 75% of our project proposal, finishing the last 25% on Monday. We haven't run into any major obstacles yet, figuring out how to share a .tex document on overleaf took a bit, but in the end it turned out fine as overleaf has a built in sharing function. We are on track to finish our project proposal on time.
