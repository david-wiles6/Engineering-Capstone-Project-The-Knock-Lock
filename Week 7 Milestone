Our goal for this week was to make an outline and write most of the writing for our project proposal.

This week, we finished about 60% of our project proposal, finishing the last 40% over the weekend and on Monday. We haven't run into any major obstacles yet, figuring 
out how to share a .tex document on overleaf took a bit, but in the end it turned out fine as overleaf has a built in sharing function. We are on track to finish our 
project proposal on time.
